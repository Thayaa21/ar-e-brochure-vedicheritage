#  AR-Based E-Brochure â€“ Unity + Vuforia + ML (Client: SriVanam Vedic Heritage)

This project transformed a traditional real estate brochure into a fully immersive **AR experience**, built using Unity and enhanced with a custom ML pipeline for 3D reconstruction. Developed during my internship at Gramophone Media Lab when I was just **18 years old**, this solution was pitched by me and adopted by the company â€” resulting in **â‚¹1.6 lakh (~$2,000 USD)** revenue in its first month.

## Project Highlights

-  **Intern-Led Innovation**: Proposed and delivered at age 18 during internship.
-  **Business Impact**: Helped close multiple leads with AR-based marketing.
-  **ML-Powered 3D Mapping**: Used a 2022-era multi-view ML model to generate **3D terrain** of the propertyâ€™s hill location.
-  **Unity + Vuforia Engineering**: Built full image tracking + prefab visualization system.
-  **Complete AR Demo**: Interactive villa model, map route, terrain visualsâ€”all on Android.

## ğŸ›  Tech Stack

- Unity (2021.x)
- Vuforia SDK
- Blender (minor edits)
- C#
- Python (ML model for 3D from multi-view images)
- Android SDK

## ğŸ§¬ Why This Still Matters

Though I now focus on **AI/ML**, this project reflects:
- Real-world product thinking at a young age
- Hands-on innovation from ideation to deployment
- Creative integration of spatial computing and machine learning

> ğŸ“Œ Built from scratch. Proposed at 18. Delivered with impact.
